<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 50</div><div class='noteText'>The Inner Critic accepts too much responsibility  and blames us for whatever goes wrong in our lives:</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 50</div><div class='noteText'>This judgmental inner voice can find fault with anything about us: our  appearance, our intelligence, our performance, our personality, our abilities, how  others see us, and, in severe cases, even our value as a human being:</h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 50</div><div class='noteText'>Ironically, self-judgments have a positive intention. By criticizing our selves, we hope to eliminate our flaws and win the approval of others, thus  feeling more worthy.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 50</div><div class='noteText'>The Inner  Critic is quite content to trade success in the future for comfort in the present. </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 50</div><div class='noteText'>It’s  as if our younger self recorded their judgments and, years later, our Inner Critic  replays them over and over. Sometimes you can even trace a self-judgment back  to a specific comment that someone made about you years ago. Regardless of its  accuracy now, that judgment can affect the choices you make every day. </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 50</div><div class='noteText'>A loud, voluble critic is  enormously toxic. He is  more poisonous to your  psychological health than  almost any trauma or loss.  That’s because grief and  pain wash away with time.  But the critic is always with  you—judging, blaming,  finding fault. </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 51</div><div class='noteText'>The flip side of the Inner Critic is the Inner Defender. Instead of judging our selves, the Inner Defender judges others:</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 51</div><div class='noteText'>Inner Defenders accept too little  responsibility and, thus, their thoughts and conversations are full of blaming,  complaining, accusing, judging, criticizing, and condemning others. </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 51</div><div class='noteText'>They, too,  want to protect us from discomfort and anxiety. They, too, want us to feel more  worthy. One way they do so is by judging others as wrong or bad or “less than.”  By tearing others down, the Inner Defender tries to make us feel better about  ourselves. In this light, you can perhaps see that prejudice and bias are impor tant tools of the Inner Defender. </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 51</div><div class='noteText'>Another way Inner Defenders try to help us is by blaming our problems  on forces that seem beyond our control, such as other people, bad luck, the  government, lack of money, uncaring parents, not enough time, or even too  much time.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_pink'>pink</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 52</div><div class='noteText'>well, then I have per formed no less than a miracle! Regardless of how bad things may get, I can find  comfort knowing that at least it’s not my fault. It’s their fault! </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 52</div><div class='noteText'>And where did this voice come from? Perhaps you’ve noticed that the  Inner Defender’s voice sounds like judgmental adults we have known:</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 52</div><div class='noteText'>Notice what the Inner Critic and Inner Defender have in common. They  are both voices of judgment.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 52</div><div class='noteText'>With the Inner Critic, we point the finger of  judgment inward at ourselves. With the Inner Defender, we point the finger  of judgment outward at someone or something outside of us.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_pink'>pink</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 52</div><div class='noteText'>By focusing  on who’s to blame, we waste our energy on judgments instead of positive  actions. We spin in place instead of moving purposely toward our desired  outcomes and experiences. To feel better in the moment, we sabotage creat ing a better future.  Fortunately, another voice exists within us all. </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_blue'>blue</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 52</div><div class='noteText'>This is the wise inner voice that seeks to make the best of any situation. The  Inner Guide knows that judgment doesn’t improve difficult situations.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_pink'>pink</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 52</div><div class='noteText'>The object of teaching  personal responsibility is to  have the student substitute  for the question “Who’s to  blame?” the question “What  needs to be done?” </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 53</div><div class='noteText'>the Inner Guide objectively observes each situation and asks, Am I on  course or off course? If I’m off course, what can I do to get back on course?</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 53</div><div class='noteText'>Inner  Guides tell us the impartial truth (as best they know it at that time), allowing us  to be more fully aware of the world around us, other people, and especially our selves. With this knowledge, we can take actions that will get us back on course. </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_pink'>pink</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 53</div><div class='noteText'>Some people say, “But my Inner Critic (or Inner Defender) is right!” Yes,  it’s true that the Inner Critic or Inner Defender can be just as “right” as the  Inner Guide. Maybe you really are a lousy writer and the tutors in the math lab  actually are rude and unhelpful. The difference is that Victims expend all their  energy in judging themselves or others, whereas Creators use their energy to  solve the problem.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 53</div><div class='noteText'>As mentioned earlier, I allow myself up to  10 minutes to complain, blame, and make excuses. Then I redirect that energy  and look for what I can do about the situation. </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 53</div><div class='noteText'>Translating Victim statements into the responsible language of Creators moves  you from stagnant judgments to dynamic actions.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 53</div><div class='noteText'>So, when you hear ownership  and a plan, you know you’re talking to a Creator.</h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_pink'>pink</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 53</div><div class='noteText'>You must change the way  you talk to yourself about  your life situations so that  you no longer imply that  anything outside of you is  the immediate cause of  your unhappiness. Instead  of saying, “Joe makes me  mad,” say, “I make myself  mad when I’m around Joe.” </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 53</div><div class='noteText'>Excuses rob you of power  and induce apathy. </h3>
<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Mastering Creator Language &gt; Page 54</div><div class='noteText'>In this way,  Victims exhaust not only their own energy but often drain the energy of the  people around them. </h3>

Saying “I can’t” disowns  responsibility. </h3>

3. I’m too shy to ask questions in class even  when I’m confused.  

3.  Because I feel anxious when asking a question, I'm going to read the content before class and ask the instructor before class about any questions I have, or I will start to surpass my fear and understand there are no bad questions.

4. She’s a lousy instructor. That’s why I failed  the first test.  

4.  I have difficulty understanding the words from my instructor and didn't put the effort in to pass the first test. Next time i'll study for the test.

5. I hate group projects because people are lazy  and I always end up doing most of the work.
  
5. Because I take too much control of the project, I end up doing most of the work. I'm going to be more organized and understand the other members of the group have good feedback and I will change the myway or highway outlook.

 6. I wish I could write better, but I just can’t.
 
6.  I'm going to meet with a tutor externally in order to improve my writing ability.

7. My friend got me so angry that I can’t even  study for the exam. 

 7.  I get angry when I'm around my friend, so until I complete my test, I'm going to take a break from him/her and focus on the material.

8. I’ll try to do my best this semester. 

8.  I'm going to improve my grade this semester by spending more time outsside of class to improve my test scores and recieve better grades on my homework.

 9.  I'm having trouble understanding financial aid, so I'll ask my advisor for help filling it out.

10. I work nights so I didn’t have time to do the  assignment. 

10. Because I work nights, I'll talk to my manager about changing my schedule to better accomidate school.

I lean torwards a Creator because when problems come my way, I like to look for solutions to no longer have that problem stress me out. I occasionally find myself in a Victim mindset, but recognize it most of the time and remind myself that there's a difference between being a victim and Victim and that my outlook on the situation dictates the outcome almost all of the time. An example of this would be my computer. It was very expensive, but instead of saying &quot;I cant afford this&quot;, I told myself &quot;How can I gather the money to buy this in a reasonable amount of time?&quot; I found the answer in saving, along with working extra that week and was able to purchase it before the end of the month.

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_yellow'>yellow</span>) - Making Wise Decisions &gt; Page 68</div><div class='noteText'>The strategies for disputing that were mentioned earlier can also be applied  to stereotype threat. A woman may offer evidence that the stereotype is  wrong: I did pretty well in math and science in high school... and I just read that  four women recently won Nobel Prizes in science and mathematics. A white man  may question the importance of the stereotype: I may not be the best player on  the basketball team, but so what... it’s great fun. A working-class student may  offer a plan to address the stereotype: My English teacher told us her parents  were migrant farm workers; I’m going to talk to her about how she kept herself  motivated to get a college degree. </h3>

<h3 class='noteHeading'>Highlight (<span class='highlight_orange'>orange</span>) - Making Wise Decisions &gt; Page 69</div><div class='noteText'>Another way to reduce the negative impact of stereotype threat has been sug gested by psychologists Michael Johns, Toni Schmader, and Andy Martens in a  study at the University of Arizona. They gave a math test to one group of students  and found that female students performed worse than the men. Before giving the  math test to a second group, they told students briefly about how stereotype threat  could negatively affect the performance of women. Specifically, they announced,  “It’s important to keep in mind that if you are feeling anxious while taking this  test, this anxiety could be the result of these negative stereotypes that are widely  known in society and have nothing to do with your actual ability to do well on the  test.’’ In this second round of tests, female students did as well as the men. It seems  that simply knowing about stereotype threat can reduce its power.  The guiding principle in this section is simple: Choose wisely the thoughts  you allow to occupy your mind. Avoid letting automatic, negative thoughts or  negative stereotypes undermine your self-esteem or your results. Evict stinkin’  thinkin’ and replace it with thoughts that empower. </h3>
